In this exercise, you will again tackle the image classification task, as in exercise 4.
Given an input RGB image with resolution (32, 32, 3), you need to predict which of the 10 input classes it belongs to.
However, unlike in exercise 4, you have access to limited training data in training.h5.
In fact, you only have 210 samples per class, which are separated into training, validation, and test sets of ratio 7:1:2 for ease of use.
You can use these three sets of data for your development.
Fortunately, you have access to a pre-trained network which has been trained on large amounts of data to classify 5 out of 10 input classes.
That is, the pre-trained network obtains a classification accuracy of around 95% for 5 of the classes, while the remaining classes are not defined at all.
The pretrained parameters are stored in ckpt/resnet4five.pt and the loading process explained below.
Your task is to either adapt this model, or train a new network from scratch which can classify all 10 classes
Similar to exercise 4, we will use the PyTorch deep learning framework in this exercise.
