Given an input RGB image, you should train a neural network which outputs the class label the image belongs to.
There are six class labels in our dataset: "buildings", "forests", "mountains", "glacier", "sea", and "street".
In order to design and train your network, we provide a training set and validation set along with class labels for every image.
As you are already familiar, we separate the dataset into three splits: training, validation, and testing.
The train set has 6K images (1K per class), and the val and test sets each have 1.2K images (200 per class).

This exercise acts as a gentle introduction to PyTorch, one of the most popular deep learning frameworks.
We provide a majority of the code to get you started and familiarized with the framework.
Running through all the cells will give you a simple linear network that can achieve the baseline performance.
To pass, you will need to modify the given implementation and train a network that can achieve better performance.
Evaluation Criteria
Your algorithm will be evaluated using classification accuracy, which is the proportion of images with the correct predicted label.
The final EvaluationScore is obtained as the classification accuracy over all test samples.
