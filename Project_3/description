In this project you have to solve the stereo vision problem:
Given two images showing a scene from different points of view, the goal is to reconstruct 3D world coordinates for each point in the scene.
You will develop an algorithm, that has as a final output a point cloud, which you will be able to visualize.
The performance will be evaluated based on the dense distance map, i.e. the map of Z coordinates.
Additionally the algorithm should output pixel-wise certainties, i.e. a value indicating how certain the prediction of that pixel is.
One possible strategy :
There certainly are more than one good solution to this problem.
Here we briefly describe the steps of one possible implementation:
Determine all camera calibration parameters. As the parameters might change between scenes - this should be automated.
To invert the projection equations (see below) it is necessary to solve the correspondence problem,
i.e. the knowledge of which pixel in the first view corresponds to a given pixel in the second view (and vice versa).
The special camera setup in this exercise implies very simple epipolar lines.
This simplifies the correspondece search. During this search a similarity measure of two pixels might come in handy.
One such similarity measure was discussed in the lecture - the Normalised Cross Correlation (NCC) of patches.
Triangulate the 3D world coordinates for every pixel pair in the left and right image.
