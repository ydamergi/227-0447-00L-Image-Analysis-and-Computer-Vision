Your tic-tac-toe championship was a major success and everyone is waiting for the next event from you.
Meanwhile, some curious eyes have also noticed the impressive compression algorithm you developed.
Among them is a group of budding entrepreneurs who are working on a noble mission:
to empower everyone to make their own Cat Memes.
Specifically, they are developing an app where you can take a photo of your cute cat, segment it out, and paste it on any background to design your own meme.
Crucially, the users only have to create a few scribbles, which mark the foreground (the cat) and background of the image.
As none of the founders are Computer Vision engineers, they have approached you to develop the segmentation algorithm for the app.
Details about the setup
For each test sample, the algorithm is provided a triplet consisting of the RGB image, the foreground (FG) scribble and the background (BG) scribble. 
We denote this triplet as a sample.
FG scribble is a grayscale image, where white pixels (255) are guaranteed to belong to the foreground (cat).
BG scribble is a grayscale image, where white pixels (255) are guaranteed to belong to the background.
The RGB image is a discrete image of 3 channels. Each pixel in these images is an integer which can take values between [0, 255]
All images of a sample have the same size. However, note that RGB images from two different samples may have different sizes.
