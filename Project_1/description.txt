You are organizing a tic-tac-toe championship with your friends,
where all the games will be played on a gaming console, i.e. on a digital board. 
Due to the wide interest in the championship, you want to share the live games on internet.
Thus, you plan to record the games using an external camera, and transmit it.
Your friend from mechanical engineering has already agreed to help you with the camera setup.
Unfortunately, being a poor student, you can only afford a cheap camera which provides you noisy images.
To make the matter worse, your internet connection is poor and hence you cannot transmit the full images directly due to large file size.
Thus you decide to use your knowledge to design a software which can
i) compress the images obtained from the camera for efficient transmission
ii) reconstruct the compressed images on the client side to generate a high quality, noise free, output.
